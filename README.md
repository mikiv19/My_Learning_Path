# My_Learning_Path
I’ve mapped out a learning path to go from programming basics to advanced software architecture and machine learning in 18-24 months. Starting with Python, Lisp, and Haskell, I’ll tackle data science, machine learning, and build scalable systems. Along the way, I’ll work on real-world projects to build a strong portfolio.


#### Comprehensive Learning Path for Programming, Data Science, and Software Architecture.

This plan aims to build a strong foundation in programming, data science, machine learning, and software architecture, with a focus on R, Python, C++, Java. While also exploring other languages and various programming paradigms and gain practical experience through projects.

**Expected Timeframe:** This plan is designed for a dedicated 8-hour daily commitment for 5 days a week. It will likely take around ***18-24 months*** to complete.
