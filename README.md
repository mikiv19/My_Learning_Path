# My_Learning_Path
I’ve mapped out a learning path to go from programming basics to advanced software architecture and machine learning in 18-24 months. Starting with Python, Lisp, and Haskell, I’ll tackle data science, machine learning, and build scalable systems. Along the way, I’ll work on real-world projects to build a strong portfolio.
